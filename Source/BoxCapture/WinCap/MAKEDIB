# To build for a release version, build with:

# To assume Microsoft C 6.0 or earlier, add the macro definition

# comes with the SDK or if you want to do advanced processing in
# libentry.asm, you may assemble the one from the SDK.  To do this,
# copy libentry.asm from your SDK directory.  Note that you must remove
# the line "include CONVDLL.INC" from the 3.1 libentry.asm for it
# to assmeble correctly.

# This line is for MASM 6.0.  If you use MASM 6.0, be sure to use the
# cmacros.inc file that comes with it.  Do not use the cmacros.inc that
# comes with the SDK as it is for MASM 5.1.

#
# To take care of this situation, just delete the file DIBAPI.DLL and
# re-run NMAKE on this makefile.

# To modify this makefile to allow for this case would require
# redundancies and multiple calls to implib, so a tradeoff was made
# to make this makefile run a bit quicker, and be a bit easier to
